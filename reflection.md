1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
    - I learned that padding adds space within elements, borders line elements, and margins add space around elements.
2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
    - What helped with learning positioning in CSS was including a 'debug' class to every element which added a 1px solid red border. Once I had essentially a grid of boxes, I was able to see exactly where elements were on the page in relation to each other. Sometimes your intention with using a certain style does not translate on the page, which can be frustrating with CSS. It takes a process of trial and error to end up with the positioning you want, especially when using the various measurement units like em, % and pixels. I also had to figure out when to use Atomic design class names versus class names that are specific to the tag.
3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
    - I think the Atomic design approach and its naming conventions are extremely helpful with styling and easy to implement. Naming classes based on the style property, like fl-l for float left, helps with getting a sense of the positioning of elements just by looking at the HTML. What was difficult was the concept of 'clearfix' which I had to lookup more than once to fully understand (it's used for an element to automatically clear its child elements, so I had to use this in the header so that the nav bar wouldn't ride up into the main content area). Another difficulty I had was fixing the footer to the bottom of the page.
4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
    -I'd say the most valuable thing I learned was using the class name of 'debug' as mentioned above to delineate the elements. Then as you make changes to the positioning, margins, and padding, you can see exactly what and where the issues are. It's grreeeaaaatttt.
