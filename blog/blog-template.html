Reflection

- Creating the wireframe for this assignment was pretty easy as there weren't too many elements to include. It was clear that a main section would be needed for the blog post, along with links to the other posts as an aside. Wireframing took the longest, but once we finished creating the HTML was fairly easy and straightforward. However, I would imagine wireframing a more complicated site with a pair may be a bit more difficult.
- Wireframing is extremely helpful for the development process. It allows for you to visualize exactly what the site will look like and easily move elements around. It's exponentially harder to move things around during the coding phase so wireframing is key to solidifying a design. Also, it is very easy to refine/edit the design in the wireframing stage as opposed to the development stage.
- To make a good wireframe we decided that a header with navigation was important in each wireframe, as the nav orients the user to where on your site he/she is and where he/she can go. You also want the allow the user to freely and easily navigate to the other pages of your site without having the use the back button.
- New HTML5 semantic elements we used were header, article and footer. -->
