        <h4> What is version control? What are the benefits of it? <h4>
        <p> Version control is a method of organizing, monitoring, and recording succesive changes made to a file (in our case, we'll talk about working with code). Let's say you're working on an application [idea?]. You create a fresh file and start codin' away! You work on your app for a couple days, then go on a trip to Greece 'cus you've always wanted a pedicure where you stick your feet in a pool of fish. You come back with smooth, fish-nibbled feet, but wait, you have no idea what you did with your code. Did you add the Photoshopped logo? What about fixing the JS sign-in page? Now you're stressed and the skin on your feet start to crack. So much for a vacay. </p>
        <p> WELL, there's still hope. What if the next time you made any change, that change was tracked? Then as you make more and more changes, the progression of your program is suddenly clear and you can SEE those changes. Sounds divine, right? It is thanks to version control. As you continue on your app, you install version control software on your computer. Now as you write code, you sync your changes to the software and BADA-BOOM you've got a beautifully compiled list of all your changes. </p>
        <p> Now let's say your app is building traction. You tell your grandmother about it, whose dentures specialist's secretary's cousin happens to hear about it and next thing you know you've got a team working on your idea. Now version control becomes even more essential. You have multiple people working on the same piece of code, so you're going to want to keep constant track of what's being edited, removed, and added and who's doing what. With version control, you can be a majestic hawk overlooking how your code evolves. </p>
