        <h4> What is version control? What are the benefits of it? <h4>
        <p> Version control is a method of organizing, monitoring, and recording succesive changes made to a file (in our case, we'll talk about working with code). Let's say you're working on an application [idea?]. You create a fresh file and start codin' away! You work on your app for a couple days, then go on a trip to Greece 'cus you've always wanted a pedicure where you stick your feet in a pool of fish. You come back with smooth, fish-nibbled feet, but wait, you have no idea what you did with your code. Did you add the Photoshopped logo? What about fixing the JS sign-in page? Now you're stressed and the skin on your feet start to crack. So much for a vacay. </p>
        <p> WELL, there's still hope. What if the next time you made any change, that change was tracked? Then as you make more and more changes, the progression of your program is suddenly clear and you can SEE those changes. Sounds divine, right? It is thanks to version control. As you continue on your app, you install version control software on your computer. Now as you write code, you sync your changes to the software and BADA-BOOM you've got a beautifully compiled list of all your changes. </p>
        <p> Now let's say your app is building traction. You tell your grandmother about it, whose dentures specialist's secretary's cousin happens to hear about it and next thing you know you've got a team working on your idea. Now version control becomes even more essential. You have multiple people working on the same piece of code, so you're going to want to keep constant track of what's being edited, removed, and added and who's doing what. With version control, you can be a majestic hawk overlooking how your code evolves. </p>

      <h4> How does git help you keep track of changes? <h4>
      <p> Lemme explain what exactly this 'version control software' is. Git is the name of this special software and it's the mystical (it's not actually mystical but you'll FEEL mystical using it) power behind all those changes you've been tracking. It does the tracking FOR YOU. </p>
      <p> Let's say you're back at it with that Javascript sign-in page. You've added a critical component to the code where the user's input is stored. You fer sure want git to know about this edit. So, you open up good 'ol Terminal. This is where all the git magic happens. You type 'git status' and see that the latest edit (that JS signup page) has not been 'staged.' Staging is the step where you get your file camera-ready for what's called a commit. You must stage your file before 'committing' to a change. To stage a change you simply type 'git add [FILE NAME]'. Now you can proceed to committing the change so git can track it. You type 'git commit -m "commit message." Now don't make a lousy commit message like "sign up page". 'Sign-up page' is lousy for a couple reasons. First, it must include a verb, specifically in the imperative, present tense. So you'd need to edit that message to "Add sign-up page." Secondly, you'll want to be specific, but keeping the number of characters to between 50 and 72. Why? Read about it <a href="http://365git.tumblr.com/post/3308646748/writing-git-commit-messages">here</a>. A re-edit of the commit message would result in "Grab user value and store in variable." See the difference? So specific! Coolio. Now that code edit is recorded and you, along with your team members, can refer to it whenever, even after another vacation to Cancun 'cus you heard Kim Kardashian is going to be there and you want to witness botox injections gone wrong. No wonder she wears duster coats more nowadays. </p>
